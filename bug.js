This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the ref's callback is executed.  This can happen in scenarios like navigating away from a screen quickly or when dealing with asynchronous operations that complete after the component is unmounted.  Attempting to access or modify the ref's current value after unmounting leads to this error.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate an asynchronous operation
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (myRef.current) {
        myRef.current.focus(); // Error occurs if component unmounted
      }
    }, 1000);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <TextInput ref={myRef} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
